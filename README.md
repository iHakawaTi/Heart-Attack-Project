# Project Overview
The dataset used in this project contains various health metrics and risk factors associated with heart attacks. Through EDA, we aim to identify significant patterns, trends, and relationships in the data, enabling us to gain a better understanding of the key factors contributing to heart disease.

After EDA, a Logistic Regression model is applied to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on these risk factors. The model is evaluated to ensure its effectiveness and reliability for heart attack prediction.

Key Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions, relationships, and trends in the data.
- Feature Selection: Identifying important features that contribute to heart attack risk.
- Logistic Regression Model: Building and training a logistic regression classifier for heart attack prediction.
- Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to assess the model's performance.
